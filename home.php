        <h1>History of Skiing in Vermont</h1>
        
        <p>Since the early 20’th century, skiing has been a part of Vermont 
            culture. Back in 1934, a tow rope powered by a Model-T Ford was set 
            up on a slope on Clint Gilbert’s farm in Woodstock. This primitive 
            lift ushered in a new era of skiing to the entire United States, 
            being the first device of its kind to be solely used to transport 
            skiers up the hill. In the 1920’s, Vermont Forester Perry Merrill 
            received permission from the state of Vermont to cut the first 
            purpose-built ski trails and construct a lodge at Stowe’s Mount 
            Mansfield. In 1939, the state authorized the lease of the land on 
            Mount Mansfield to private developers to allow them to construct a 
            ski resort. While it is ambiguous which mountain can claim the 
            title of  the first ‘real’ ski resort in the US, Stowe makes a very 
            good case for itself. By the 1940-1941 season, the longest chair 
            lift in the world had been constructed at stowe, stretching a full 
            mile up the slope and further revolutionizing ski culture. Soon ski 
            resorts began to pop up all over the state and before long, Vermont 
            became one of the nation’s biggest skiing hotspots. Fast forward to 
            the 1980’s when a man in living in Londonderry Vermont named Jake 
            Burton Carpenter began modifying Snurfers, a popular toy resembling 
            a snowboard without bindings, to have a metal edge like skis and 
            bindings to lock your feet in place. Carpenter is credited with the 
            invention of the modern-day snowboard, and went on to create Burton 
            Snowboards, now the largest snowboarding company in the world.</p>
