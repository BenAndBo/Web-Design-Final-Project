            <li>My name is Ben Wasser, I am 19 years old, and I am generally referred to as the sickest skier on the mountain. I grew up in Stowe and have easily skied well over 1000 days on the slopes of Mt. Mansfield. I think growing up in Vermont is part of the reason that I have become the skier that I am today. The east coast offers a different kind of terrain than most ski mountains out west or in Europe. Its icy more often than not so you have to learn to carve hard, and there also are usually only 2-3 big powder dumps every year, so you have to take advantage and charge hard when you get them, or sometimes work with whatever snow the mountain gives you.</li>
            
            <li>My name is Bo Warren and I grew up snowboarding on the East Coast. I have been snowboarding for 14 years, however this is my first year riding primarily in Vermont. I have been to Vermont resorts a few times in the past but no more than a handful of days a year. I like being from the East Coast because of the gritty mentality. It doesn’t matter if it’s pouring rain and there is two trails open, you will surely see people ripping East Coast resorts day by day. You don’t get that kind of dedication anywhere else. This is why my colleague and I have decided to create a hub for Vermont rippers. We wanted to create a website where people who love riding Vermont could see mountain statistics, watch videos from Vermont resorts, and get the latest updates on the various resorts.</li>

        <h2 id="hist">History of Skiing in Vermont</h2>
        
        <p id="history">Since the early 20’th century, skiing has been a part of Vermont 
            culture. Back in 1934, a tow rope powered by a Model-T Ford was set 
            up on a slope on Clint Gilbert’s farm in Woodstock. This primitive 
            lift ushered in a new era of skiing to the entire United States, 
            being the first device of its kind to be solely used to transport 
            skiers up the hill. In the 1920’s, Vermont Forester Perry Merrill 
            received permission from the state of Vermont to cut the first 
            purpose-built ski trails and construct a lodge at Stowe’s Mount 
            Mansfield. In 1939, the state authorized the lease of the land on 
            Mount Mansfield to private developers to allow them to construct a 
            ski resort. While it is ambiguous which mountain can claim the 
            title of  the first ‘real’ ski resort in the US, Stowe makes a very 
            good case for itself. By the 1940-1941 season, the longest chair 
            lift in the world had been constructed at stowe, stretching a full 
            mile up the slope and further revolutionizing ski culture. Soon ski 
            resorts began to pop up all over the state and before long, Vermont 
            became one of the nation’s biggest skiing hotspots. Fast forward to 
            the 1980’s when a man in living in Londonderry Vermont named Jake 
            Burton Carpenter began modifying Snurfers, a popular toy resembling 
            a snowboard without bindings, to have a metal edge like skis and 
            bindings to lock your feet in place. Carpenter is credited with the 
            invention of the modern-day snowboard, and went on to create Burton 
            Snowboards, now the largest snowboarding company in the world.</p>
